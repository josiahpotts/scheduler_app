THIS DOCUMENT IS AN UNOFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS AND TIP RESOURCE

Installing from scratch (macOS)
1. Python environment:
    - Within the top directory of the app (cs428-scheduler) type:
        python -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
    - You should now be in the environment (env)
    - Within env type:
        pip install flask
        pip install flask_pymongo
        pip install flask_login
        pip install flask_bcrypt
    - This should conclude dependencies but OPTIONAL to type:
        pip install -r App/requirements.txt
    - At this point the flask web application can be run, type:
        python App/app.py
    - Go to 'http://localhost:5000'
    - Register a user!

2. Docker and MongoDB
    - Download the docker desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
      and run it.
    - Verify install by typing in a new terminal:
        docker --version
    - Next, to run the MongoDB container, type:
        docker pull mongo
        docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
    - Now to enter the MongoDB bash, type:
        docker exec -it mongodb bash
    - This should take you to the MongoDB bash and look like "root@something...", type:
        mongosh
    - If it says something like "test>" then you're in! Switch to app.py's database:
        use Scheduler
        show collections
    - If you registered a user on the web app, then "users" should be present! You did it!
